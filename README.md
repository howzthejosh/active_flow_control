# Flow control with AI
This repository stores the codes and instructions necessary to understand the workflow used in my Individual research project which deals with flow control. 
We draw inspiration from Rabault et al. (2019) who indicated that flow control using Deep reinforcement learning was possible. However, drawbacks include non-realistic sensor placement and need for robustness (varying Reynolds numbers).
